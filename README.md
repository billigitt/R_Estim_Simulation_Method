# rInstantCorrection
MATLAB code (and accompanying figures) for correcting errors incurred in renewal equation estimation of instantaneous reproduction number.

We split this project into two sub-directories, 'Functions' and 'Simulation_Approach'. 

In 'Functions', we list all the code for the MATLAB functions used within the project. 

In 'Simulation_Approach', we have six sub-directories: 'Cluster', 'Scripts', 'RealWorldData', 'SchematicsAndFigures' and 'EMComparison', which have brief descriptions below:

'Cluster': Files used requiring SLURM/ Computer cluster
'Scripts': Scripts used to produce figures in manuscripts
'RealWorldData': Data files used throughout analysis
'SchematicsAndFigures': All schematics and figures (non code-based) and their derivations used in manuscripts
'EMComparison': File for analysis comparing with Expectation-Maximisation method (Nash et al.)
