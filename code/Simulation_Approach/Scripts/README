This file contains a description of all the .m files in this folder. You will also see .mat files in the uploaded GitHub repository. This is because some of the .mat files are generated by the .m files which have "Analysis" in their titles. If you want to re-create the figures from scratch, you do not need to run the Analysis files, only files which have "Creation" in their title.

The files containing "Figure2" in their title relate to Figure 2 in the manuscript.
The files containing "FigureS2" in their title relate to Figure S2 in the supplementary manuscript.
The files containing "Wales" in their title relate to the real-world study parts of the manuscript.
